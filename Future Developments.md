# Future Developments

## User Interface
* UI has 2 modes you select from at startup; face (<6 ft away) and pose (>6 ft away)

## Optimization
* Research [hardware configuration](https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/mlkit/vision/pose/PoseDetectorOptionsBase) for possible performance improvements

## Additional Features
* On device microphones that enable device to [look towards the loudest sound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgrFabQvES4) in the event the camera fails to find a person over a period of time (allows user to clap loudly or shout "HEY!" for the camera to find it)
